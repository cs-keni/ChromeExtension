## Purpose
This is just a chrome extension project to add onto the resume. It just lets me learn about some front-end development. I didn't really want to pay the $5 registration fee so it's not public and only available on my own PC.

## License
No license! I don't really care if you want to clone my repository and take it for yourself. I can always make another chrome extension. Again, it's just a project to help me learn so I can make better ones in the future.
